In order to use the application, create a virtual environment and pip install the required libraries listed in "requirements.txt".
1. python -m venv DigitEnv
2. source DigitEnv/bin/activate
3. pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 2 activates the environment and step 3 installs the required libraries. <br/> Once this is set, run the "PyGameWindow.py" file to start the game!
